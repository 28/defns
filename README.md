# defns

A library that provides an interface for defining functions
with type signatures for which pre and post conditions are
generated using spec.

## Usage

``` clojure
user> (require '[defns.core :as defns])
nil

user> (defns/defns test-fn
        [defns/Fn [defns/Int defns/Int] defns/Int]
        [a b]
        (+ a b))
#'user/test-fn

user> (test-fn 1 2)
3

user> (test-fn "1" "2")
user> ;; a currently ugly assertion error

user> ;; override test-fn to return nil instead od Int
user> (defns/defns test-fn
        [defns/Fn [defns/Int defns/Int] defns/Int]
        [a b]
        nil)
#'user/test-fn

user> (test-fn 1 2)
user> ;; another currently ugly assertion error

user> (:pretty-signature (meta #'test-fn))
["Fn" ["Int" "Int"] "Int"]
```
