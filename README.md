# defns

A library that provides a way for defining functions with type
signatures for which pre and post conditions are generated using spec.
This is an experimental idea.

## Usage

``` clojure
user> (require '[defns.core :as d])
=> nil

user> (d/defns test-fn
        [d/Fn [d/Int d/Int] d/Int]
        [a b]
        (+ a b))
=> #'user/test-fn

user> (test-fn 1 2)
=> 3

user> (test-fn "1" "2")
=>  ;; a currently ugly assertion error

user> ;; override test-fn to return nil instead of Int
user> (d/defns test-fn
        [d/Fn [d/Int d/Int] d/Int]
        [a b]
        nil)
=> #'user/test-fn

user> (test-fn 1 2)
=>  ;; another currently ugly assertion error
```

You can define your own types:
```clojure
user> (require '[clojure.spec.alpha :as s])
=> nil

user> (s/def ::first-name string?) 
=> :user/first-name

user> (s/def ::last-name string?)
=> :user/last-name

user> (d/deft Person (partial s/valid? (s/keys :req [::first-name ::last-name])))
=> #'user/Person

user> (d/defns update-first-name
       [d/Fn [Person d/Str] Person]
       [p name]
       (assoc-in p [::first-name] name))
=> #'user/update-first-name

user> (update-first-name {::first-name "John" ::last-name "Doe"} "Jane")
=> #:user{:first-name "Jane", :last-name "Doe"}

user> (update-first-name {:a 1} "Jane")
=> ;; another currently ugly assertion error
```

A couple of useful things that are possible with defns:
``` clojure
user> (d/pretty-sig #'test-fn)
=> ["Fn" ["Int" "Int"] "Int"]

user> (d/applies? #'test-fn [1 2])
=> true

user> (d/applies? #'test-fn ["a" "b"])
=> false

user> (d/valid-result? #'test-fn 1)
=> true

user> (d/valid-result? #'test-fn "1")
=> false
```
